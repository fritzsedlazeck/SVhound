# SVhound

SVhound is a framework to predict regions that harbour so far unidentified genotypes of Structural Variations. It uses a population size VCF file as input and reports the probabilities and regions across the population. 
SVhound was tested and applied to the 1000genomes VCF file and also other data sets. 


## Quickstart



## Rhesus macaque SV Calling

We identified SV from 150 Illumina data sets based on bwa mem mappints to the v8 of the reference genome. The SV were identified by Manta and subsequently merged and filtered using SURVIVOR.
